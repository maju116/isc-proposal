# Signatories
<!-- 
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on popularity but community acceptance is important.  Willingness to accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery. 

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R are proposed.
-->

This proposal is created as a succession of the recently finished first instance of the `platypus` package for multi-class object detection and image segmentation. It aims at delivering extended functionality to the R community. First version of the package is available on github: https://github.com/maju116/platypus.

The reason behind our belief in the `platypus` usefulness is the support and eagerness to establish cooperation with us that has been already expressed by both the [MLR Team](https://mlr-org.com/) and the [WhyR Foundation](http://whyr.pl/foundation/). It is also not an exploratory project but rather development of the existing MVP. All that because of the tremendous work that the `platypus` main creator put into bringing the idea out of the concept phase and putting in the cornerstone for this proposed project.


## Project team
<!-- 
Who are the people responsible for actually delivering the project if the proposal gets accepted and are already signed up and rearing to go?
-->
The mastermind behind the package and main team member is [Michał Maj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-maj116/). He's a data scientist with over 5 years of experience in the field, R/Shiny developer and a freelancer interested in deep/machine learning and statistics. He loves challenges and is always ready to help solving data science problems. In his day to day work he is responsible for designing, testing and development of advanced deep and machine learning models in R and Python. He's a big R language enthusiast and a co-organizer of [R Enthusiasts meetups in Gdańsk](https://www.meetup.com/Trojmiejska-Grupa-Entuzjastow-R/). 

Another core member representing mainly the AI section of the project is Jakub Borkowski. Bio Jakuba: .....

Last but not least member is Tadeusz Satława, connecting the ideas of Data Science and the reliable programming practices. He graduated in 2012 from Applied Computer Science at AGH with BSc and MSc theses related to ECG signal processing. He also has a BSc from Biomedical Engineering at AGH and did an internship as a teaching assistant at the University. He gathered experience as a software engineer and data scientist in several companies.


## Contributors
<!-- 
Who are the people who have actively helped with this proposal but won't necessarily be on the core project team later?
-->
For the time being people contributing are solely the team members. In the nearest future, after the first stage of development, we will be eager to welcome any suggestions and assistance in enhancing `platypus` functionalities. 

## Consulted
<!-- 
Who has been given the opportunity to provide feedback on the proposal? This should include any R Consortium & ISC members who the proposal has been discussed with.
-->
We are being constantly consulted by Marcin Kosiński from the [WhyR Foundation](http://whyr.pl/foundation/). There are also our colleagues from the Chionis team. Chionis was founded as the response to the needs of a local medical facilities chain. We were developing the XAI - powered automatic diagnosis tool while gaining the experience crucial for meeting the milestones stated in this proposal. 

Some of the Chionis members are:

 1. Patryk Jasik PhD, Assistant Professor, working within the Gdańsk University of Technology, involved in handful of R&D projects combining AI and medicine. 
 2. Mariusz Liksza, Data Science Manager at Kinesso [WYDAJE MI SIE ZE WYZSZY AUTORYTET JEST POTRZEBNY]
 3. Adrian Kastrau, Data Scientist at Kinesso, his master thesis is immersed deeply in the subject of human emotions recognition. [WYDAJE MI SIE ZE WYZSZY AUTORYTET JEST POTRZEBNY]
