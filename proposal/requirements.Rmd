# Requirements
<!-- 
An idea of what is required to make the project actually happen
-->

## People
<!--
Who needs to be involved, what's the proposed structure, what will it take to get their involvement?
-->

The core team working on the project includes:

1. Michał Maj -- the head of the project, responsible for the workflow, the core code of the project and implementation of deep learning architectures
2. Jakub Borkowski -- the developer of core code of the project,
3. Tadeusz Satława -- the developer of core code of the project,

## Processes
<!-- 
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->

Package code can be found here: https://github.com/maju116/platypus, it will be used as a basis for the project. There will be weekly meetings of the group, discussing the progress of the project.

## Tools & Tech
<!--
What is going to be needed to deliver this project? 

Will cloud computing be used - if yes are there are necessary components that will be deciding factors between providers?

Are there tools or tech that don't exist that will be produced to facilitate the project?
-->

We will use `devtools`, `roxygen2`, `testthat`, `covr`, `lintr` and other R packages for the purposes of the appropriate package development.

## Funding
<!-- 
[TO DO] THE GUIDANCE IS PRETTY UNCLEAR, ESP IN LIGHT OF GABOR'S PROPOSAL VS AWARD SIZE

-->

In order to pursue the development, staff time costs need to be subsidized:

* Q1: $10,000
* Q2: $10,000
* Q3: $10,000
