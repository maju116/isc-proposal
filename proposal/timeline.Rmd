# Project plan

## Start-up phase
<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is important because projects need to get up and running quickly.


 - [ ] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [ ] Licence decisions
 - [ ] Reporting framework
-->
`platypus` was in development already for few months. It was published as an open-source package on github: https://github.com/maju116/platypus under MIT licence.  

## Technical delivery
<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should provide at least a high-level the implementation. 

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery
-->

The project is outlined for a 9 month period. The following milestones summarize the technical deliveries by quarter:

Q1 (01.01.2021-31.03.2021): Payment of technical debt (writing unit test for existing infrastructure, adding examples, creating more advanced CI, multi-platform testing), addition of basic data augmentation methods.

Q2 (01.04.2021-30.06.2021): Added ability to read medical images in DICOM (and possibly NIFTI) format, preprocessing method for medical images like CLASHE, addition of more advanced data augmentation methods, first CRAN release. 

Q3 (01.07.2021-30.09.2021): Addition of at least two new deep learning architectures for object detection and image segmentation (e.g. Faster R-CNN, YOLOv4/5, SSD, U-Net++), second CRAN release. 

## Other aspects
<!--
Covering non-technical activities like on-going publicity, paper preparation, discussion groups etc. that might be required to facilitate successful delivery of the project.

The achieved milestones of development of the `platypus` will be covered on:

1. Blog of Micha≈Ç Maj
2. R bloggers,
3. Twitter,
4. LinkedIn.

During the project, `platypus` will be presented on many R conferences, workshops and meetings (for the time being we have two conferences confirmed: WhyR?2020: https://2020.whyr.pl/ and Data Science summit 2020: https://dssconf.pl/)
