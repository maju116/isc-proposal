# Project plan

## Start-up phase
<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is important because projects need to get up and running quickly.


 - [ ] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [ ] Licence decisions
 - [ ] Reporting framework
-->
For the time being the `platypus` has already been under development for few months. It was published as an open-source package on github: https://github.com/maju116/platypus under the MIT licence. The funding would just let us continue our work on the project. 

## Technical delivery
<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should provide at least a high-level the implementation. 

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery
-->

The project is outlined for 12-month period. The following summarize the technical deliveries by quarter:

Q1 (01.01.2021-31.03.2021): Payment of the technological debt: writing unit test for the existing infrastructure, adding examples, creating more advanced CI (for other R versions and running on Linux, Windows and Mac), multi-platform testing, addition of the basic data augmentation methods (translation, contrast manipulation, white noise addition).

Q2 (01.04.2021-30.06.2021): Addition of ability to read medical images in the DICOM format, preprocessing methods for medical images (e.g. CLAHE), addition of more advanced data augmentation methods, first CRAN release. 

Q3 (01.07.2021-30.09.2021): Addition of at least one new deep learning architecture for image segmentation (e.g. Faster R-CNN, YOLOv4/5, SSD, U-Net++), second CRAN release.

Q4 (01.10.2021-31.12.2021): Addition of at least one new deep learning architecture for object detection (e.g. Faster R-CNN, YOLOv4/5, SSD, U-Net++), third CRAN release. 


## Other aspects
<!--
Covering non-technical activities like on-going publicity, paper preparation, discussion groups etc. that might be required to facilitate successful delivery of the project.

 - [ ] Announcement post
 - [ ] Delivery blog post
 - [ ] Twitter
 - [ ] UseR!
 - [ ] ISC meetings
-->

Each of the finished quarter and achieved milestones associated with development of the `platypus` will be described on:

1. Blog of Micha≈Ç Maj
2. R bloggers,
3. Twitter,
4. LinkedIn.

During the project, `platypus` will be presented on as many as possible R conferences, workshops and meetings. For the time being we have two conferences confirmed: WhyR?2020: https://2020.whyr.pl/ and Data Science summit 2020: https://dssconf.pl/.
